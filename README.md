# TimeSeries_prediction_of_MultiStore_Sales
Time series analysis studies sequential data over time, uncovering trends and patterns. Techniques like ARIMA and LSTM enable forecasting, aiding decision-making in finance, weather, and more.


# Multistore Sale Time Series Prediction

This project aims to predict sales for multiple stores over time using time series forecasting techniques.

## Data Collection

- Gather sales data from multiple stores over a period of time.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data points.
- Normalize data: Scale the features to a similar range.
- Time series decomposition: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as day of the week, month, holidays, etc.

## Model Selection

- Choose appropriate time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.
- Train individual models for each store or consider a single model for all stores depending on the data and business requirements.

## Model Training

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the selected models on the training data.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
- Fine-tune the models if necessary.

## Prediction

- Make predictions using the trained models on the test data.

## Post-processing

- Compare the predicted sales with actual sales.
- Adjust the predictions based on any discrepancies or errors.

## Visualization

- Visualize the predicted sales data along with actual sales to understand the model's performance.
- Plot time series forecasts for each store.

## Deployment

- Deploy the trained model for real-time prediction or batch prediction.
- Integrate the model into the existing sales management system for decision-making.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor the model's performance over time and retrain periodically with new data.
- Update the model as necessary to adapt to changes in sales patterns or business requirements.
